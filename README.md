Well.. this doesn't work. Beans.

I suppose I should've seen it coming, given the logic I used to come up with the concept: sometimes a winter or summer ends early/late, so it'll wind up slowing-down/catching-up in spring or fall to the typical weather. But if I'm aligning a winter that ended early with one that ended late, then that'll give the early winter a forecasted steeper up-slope (from the late-ending, catching-up) than it's likely to have.

At least I'm better at R. Yippee. Maybe I can coopt some of these methods to something else.
